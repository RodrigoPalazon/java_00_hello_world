# Java Fundamentals - Portfolio

<p>
The main goal of this repository is to show the fundamentals concepts
of Java, and logic programming in general using the programming language.

It's important to highlight that is not a structured project, but a bunch
of random mini-projects and exercises that uses the most important concepts.

Some of the files(modes, test, services, etc...), can be haven't  done in the better
way, and probably it happened due a line of thoughts and explanations viewing a
way better final result. So, give it a chance and trust me, there is some light in the end of the tunel

This repository is a record of my journey due a [Java Marathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKjFuX91G5Q&list=PL62G310vn6nFIsOCC0H-C2infYgwm8SWW&index=1&t=60s) 
Youtube course (done in Portuguese).
